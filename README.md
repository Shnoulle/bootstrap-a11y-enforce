# Bootstrap A11y Enforcement
Enforce Accessibility on Bootstrap using CSS

Include this css in your project to automatically be notified of common accessibility mistakes when using bootstrap.

Alternatively, use the bookmarklet to attach to any page.

##Demo
I've created a demo with intentionally broken Bootstrap components at http://gilluminate.github.io/bootstrap-a11y-enforce/
